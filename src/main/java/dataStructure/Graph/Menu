Data structure and algorithm

1. Graph Creation
2. Graph Traversal
	a. BFS --> Queue + Visited
	b. DFS --> Stack (Recursion) + Visited
3. Cycle Detection
	a. Undirected
		i.  BFS --> Queue (Parent) + Visited
		ii. DFS --> Stack (Recursion + Parent) + Visited

5. Topological Sort
	DFS --> Stack( stores visited elements with no neighbours )+ Visited
	BFS (kahns Algorithm) --> Queue + In-degree Array

6. Cycle Detection Directed Graph
		i.  BFS --> Queue (Parent) + Visited --> In-degree Array
		ii. DFS --> Stack (Recursion + Parent) + Visited + PathVisited
4. Bipartite Graph
		a. BFS --> Queue + Visited stores color of node (0,1) , if color of adjacent node is same then it is not bipartite graph
		b. DFS --> Stack (Recursion) + Visited stores color of node (0,1) , if color of adjacent node is same then it is not bipartite graph


6. Dijkstra's Algorithm
	a. Priority Queue
	b. Using Set


7. BellMan ford algorithm
8. Floyd Algorithm
9. Minimum Spanning Tree
	Prims
	Kruskal
10. DSU (Disjoint Set Union)
11. Strongly connected Component (Kosaraju)
12. Bridges in Graph (Tarjans)
13. Articulation Point
