list of Programs:


identify the Program :
    if there is multiple ans dependent on the condition how to partition the problem
    for example : the {} decides the result in the mathematical expression
                  the boolean algebra
                  palindrome partitioning
                  partition Array
                  Count Square
    solve :
        start entire block
        try all partition
            run loop to try all partition
        return best possible of two partition
            i -> k and k + 1 -> j
